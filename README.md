Progressive Web Application (PWA)
A Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. PWAs are intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices. The concept was introduced by Google in 2015, and since then, PWAs have gained widespread adoption due to their enhanced user experience and near-native performance.

Core Features
The key features that define a PWA include:

Progressive – Works for every user, regardless of browser choice because it’s built with progressive enhancement as a core principle.

Responsive – Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations.

Connectivity Independent – Powered by service workers, PWAs can work offline or on low-quality networks.

App-like Interface – Resembles native mobile applications in behavior and navigation.

Fresh – Always up-to-date thanks to service worker updates.

Safe – Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and ensure content integrity.

Discoverable – Can be identified as “applications” thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration, enabling search engines to find them.

Re-engageable – Uses features like push notifications to keep users engaged.

Installable – Allows users to “install” the app on their device home screen without needing an app store.

Linkable – Easily shared via URL, avoiding complex installation.
